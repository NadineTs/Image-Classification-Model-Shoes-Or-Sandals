# Image Classification Model: Shoes or Sandals

This repository contains an image classification model that distinguishes between shoes and sandals. The model was trained using Teachable Machine and utilizes TensorFlow for implementation.

## Contents

- `Image_Classification_Model_Shoes_or_Sandals.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the code for classifying new image inputs.
- `converted_savedmodel.zip`: ZIP file containing the trained model from Teachable Machine.
- `TestImage.jpg`: Sample image for testing the model.

## Using the Model

1. **Upload the Model:**
   - Upload `converted_savedmodel.zip` to your environment.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
   - Open `Image_Classification_Model_Shoes_or_Sandals.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
   - Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to set up the model and make predictions.

3. **Classify Your Images:**
   - Replace the sample image path in the notebook with the path to your own image to test the model.
